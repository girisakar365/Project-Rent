About
This is my first major project as a beginner. This project is a desktop-based application based on tkinter framework. The main purpose of this program is to calculate the total amount of rent to be paid by the tenant (The person(s) or party who lives in a rent house) every month and keep it as data.
## Take away:
    1. Tkinter,PIL
    2. OOP
    3. CSV
    4. List Comprehension
    5. Pyqrcode
    6. File Management
## Conclusion:
After working for almost 2 and a half months in this project, every expected feature are included in the application. The versions up to 4.0 of the application does not include all the features and contains some kind of bugs in it. However almost every bugs of the application is identified and solved in version 6.5. Thus, we recommend you to install the 6.5 version of the application. Every version contains the code and details of the features inculded.
